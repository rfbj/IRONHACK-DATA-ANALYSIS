IRONHACK - DATA ANALYSIS FT - JAN22

PROJECT: Data cleaning and manipulation - Shark Attack

Our goal with this data cleaning and manipulation project is to answer a few questions from a business perspective, assuming our company has not been established yet.

Therefore, at first, we need to identify on what two or three countries we have the highest shark attack occurrences and, moreover, 
if they were accidental (unprovoked) or provoked.

As stated above, first of all, we need to identify where would our potential clients be located at, what should lead to the following answers:

    1.  What countries have the most shark attacks?
    2.  What countries and cities have the deadliest shark attacks?

Once we have the answers for that we should be ready to answer the next logical question:

    3.Where should our company install its headquarters at?

After deciding where we should install our headquarters at we'll need to decide on what type of business activity we should aim at. 
In order for that to be possible, we'll need to answer the following questions:

    4.  What would be our target audience? (Government, customers (male, female, does not matter?), ecc) 
    It depends on what triggered the attack: Predatory or provocative behavior?

    5.  What are shark attacks progression through years?
    6.  What season of the year are shark attacks more prevalent?
    7. Is there any gender relationship between shark attacks? How likely are men and women to be attacked?

Once we have answered the questions above we should be ready to decide:

    8.  What would be our company's business purpose? Should we sell a product (i.e. Shark repelent), 
    provide a service to warn or educate bathers/swimmers

Considering that we'd like to enrich this project, as for our future plans we'd like to deepen our research 
and check how does shark attacks relate to moon phases? This currently is our work in progress.
