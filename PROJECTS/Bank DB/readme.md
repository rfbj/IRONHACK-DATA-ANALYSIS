# BANK DB PROJECT

---

Once upon a time, there was a bank offering services to private persons. The services include managing of accounts, offering loans, etc.

The bank wants to improve their services. For instance, the bank managers have only vague idea, who is a good client (whom to offer some additional services) and who is a bad client (whom to watch carefully to minimize the bank loses). Fortunately, the bank stores data about their clients, the accounts (transactions within several months), the loans already granted, the credit cards issued The bank managers hope to improve their understanding of customers and seek specific actions to improve services.

There are several tables for you to explore, check the available data for any patterns that might separate the good and bad clients. Upload the data to your sql database and work with it there or in the python connection to sql.

Upload the project to your github and send the link to your TA. 

The files can be found here.
